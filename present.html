            <h3>Vision Board</h3>
            <p>My vision for this semester is to create a home automation app that can improve your life but can also give back your life. 
                I want to try to eliminate the need to constantly grab your phone, so you can form a healthier relationship with technology.

            <h3>My vision</h3>
            <h4>Home Automation - Augmented Reality - Video Editing </h4>
            <ul class="cat-ul">
                <p> Most of my time at home is spent on automating my studio and making sure I get the most out of my smart home devices. I believe that we should use technology
                    to improve our lives, not just make us lazy, but to set up an automaton that unconciously triggers me to change my behavior positively. This semester I will be 
                    focussing on developing my perfect automated studio further. Previous semester I worked on projects that experimented with Augmented Reality. These projects were mostly
                    about complimenting the real world with digital add ons that enhanced the experience.
                    <br><br>
                    During my project with the Effenaar, I didn’t simply look at how my vison was affected, but more in depth at why this happened.
                     I took a more birds-eye-view aproach on it and realized the following key points: 
                     
                     <ul>
                        <li>you can shape your vision by discovering new ideas </li>
                        <li>you can shape your vision by defining what you don’t want to look into further</li>
                        <li>by looking at whats has been done, being done and  could be done you can broaden your perspective</li>
                        <li>by tapping into intrinsic motivations and human needs, you can create a stronger relationship between technology and its target audience  </li>
                        <br><br>

                        
                    </ul>

                    During my project with my duo partner, I realized that there is a key difference between using technology to make your life more fun, or just easier or less hard. While I, and most if not all of my visitors, could get up and turn my lights of, I previously designed an app to turn control all my lights at home for my visitors. However there are people that cannot move or would struggle to do so a lot. Yet not all apps like my light app, that make such tasks easier, are even accessible to them in certain cases. Our target audience were quadriplegics, so we decided to make a home improvement app that they could use, by using a neuro headset. I quite enjoyed working for people in a way were I can help them not only improve their quality of lives, but also help them with their needs and gaining their own independence.  I will carry this experience with me, while looking at future projects and will perhaps try to work on a project that increases independence again and will take accessibility into my future considerations.
