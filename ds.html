        <h3>Disccussion Sparkers </h3>
        <p>Based on the motivations behind going to a festival that I learned from my <a href="festivalfeeling.html">research</a> and my thoughts on interactions, 
            I started developing a concept that will fulfil the intrinsic rewards and/or interpersonal rewards. During my progress I also kept
             in mind the previously mentioned key point about my vision for this project, and the fact that my design should not be too distracting
              to the artist.  
<br><br>
            As social beings one of the many reasons that we seek interactions is the need for a shared experience and to meet likeminded people.
             Spontaneous social interactions can be stimulated by creating an experience or space that triggers people to speak, or ‘sparks them do discus’.  
            <br><br>
            While thinking about what I learned so far, I decided that I wanted to come up with concept focussed on the following elements:  
            <br><br>
          </p>
        <p>
           
            <br> - The need to voice your opinion
            <br> - The feeling of belonging
            <br> - Visualizing the results(of a large group)
        <br>
        
<br>
The survey:<br>
As I have mentioned in , creating a space allows the opportunity for spontaneous interactions and hopefully sparks a conversation, this can be done by asking simple and concise questions. Questions related to the festival or related to the artists. 
I would not advise picking any controversial topics or sensitive subjects. These questions can be selected by the artist and the Effenaar. <br>
<br> Output of the results:<br>
What are we going to do with the results of the survey?<br>
Just like any other voting system with percentages. Bars that represent with two colors and each color represents one of the answers. <br> <br>
            <b>Installation</b>
            It could be projected on a screen or it can be shown in a physical structure or installation. In order for me to visualize the results of survey in a 
            fun and abstract way, I decided to expriment with different animations in Adobe XD.

<div class="col-md-12">
    <h3>Phase one</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, I want to create a space that allows the opportunity for spontaneous interactions and hopefully spark a conversation. This could be done
         by asking simple and concise questions. For example, questions related to the festival or related to the artists. I would not advise picking any controversial
          topics or sensitive subjects. These questions could be preselected, in collaboration with the artists or there representative and the Effenaar to flavour it to
           their own performance. 
        <br><br>
        In first phase I came up with two types of questioning and developed one of them. The concept I did not initially develop, was to create a quick poll with a 
        few questions, that had two opposing answers. The other concept I did develop was a type of poll that would have a singular question, with a multitude of answers;
         e.g. What’s your favourite album? Who is your favourite band member? Etc. You can see my first iteration in the video down below.  
        </p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>First Version</h3>
    <p>
        First version 
For the first version of the discussion sparkers, I created a visual with the top most listened songs by Drake. An online visitor would be prompted with the question 
“what’s your favourite song’, via a pinned message in the chat of something alike. The result would be visible via an installation on a screen, where QR codes could be 
located to allow the physical visitors to join in on the voting experience. As soon as the visitors entered a poll, they can see a real time physical representation of 
the results, both online and in the physical world. Hopefully this creates an environment that opens up the opportunity for spontaneous interaction.

    <h3>Second Version</h3>
    <p>After creating the first version, I wanted to allow myself to come up with some different versions with a more creative style. You can see the versions in the video below. These versions are based on the preferred album of the band Muse  </p>

    <h3>Phase two</h3>
    <p>During the second phase, based on our feedback my group came up with the idea to create light structures as a physical representation.
         Based on this idea, I started thinking about how you can represent the votes of people via LED lights. My first iteration of this, is visualised
         in the GIF on the side. It works quite similar to the math tool, an abacus. Every answer on the poll would be coupled to a colour, and each vote will 
         add to the bar of light. You can see the visualization of the light structures, over here.   </p>

<div class="col-md-12">
    <p>
        <h3>Phase three</b></h3>
        At this stage, we had collected a lot of feedback. Firstly, the Effenaar found the visualization through screens a bit dated. We changed this by working with light structures. We did receive positive feedback on this, which is why we decided to progress further with this idea. Lastly Effenaar told us they perceived the wording ‘discussion sparkers’ to be confrontational, which is why we went with conversation sparkers in the end. 
        <br><br>
        At this stage we thought some more about realizing the project into a prototype. We started by concluding arches would be a better shape. You could walk trough them, and they have fewer corners which makes it easier to apply the lighting. We also imagined it being at the entrance, allowing people to get hit with this experience, the moment they arive. <br><br>
        We decided to go for a large structure, approximately 4 meters in height, because we hoped that combined with the lighting this would attract people from a wide range. After this we gathered some led strips, designed the arches to scale and got started laser cutting the shapes.

 </div>
<div class="col-md-8">
   <h3>Phase four</h3>
   During this phase we came to the conclusion that he idea about placing this in the entrance, was not a great idea when you take safety into consideration. We instead imagined it in a wide open space, so it would still be visible from a large area.<br><br>
   At this stage we started putting the laser cut shapes together and applied the first led strips to the structure. I personally also worked on some posters. You can read about my progress over here.

 <div class="col-md-6">
   <h3>Phase five</h3>
   <p>
    In the final phase we coded the LED strips to visualize the voting in action, based on the system I represented in phase 3. We also created a video to represent the way the Led lights work. We also presented this at our final expo, where we received some feedback. They liked he visualisation of the structure.  
    <br><br>
    I also decided to represent the alternate way of framing questions for a poll, the method with simpler questions and two opposition answers. You can try the poll out for yourself over …?>>, The feedback we received that they quite liked the variation of the simple questions. It would also allow for a shorter polling time when asking multiple questions.  
    <br><br>
    Overall the final feedback on the prototype contained the following key points

    <ul>
        <li>the prototype is interesting </li>
        <li>we needed to make the distinction between opposing and dividing questions</li>
        <li>there is room to think about a signal that a, or specifically your vote, was received</li>
      
    </ul>
    I also did a usability test that you can read about <a href="present.html"
