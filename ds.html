        <h3>Disccussion Sparkers </h3>
        <p>Based on the motivations behind going to a festival that I learned from my <a href="festivalfeeling.html">research</a>and my thoughts on interactions, 
            I started developing a concept that will fulfil the intrinsic rewards and/or interpersonal rewards. Douring my progress I also kept
             in mind the previously mentioned key point about my vision for this project, and the fact that my design should not be too distracting
              to the artist.  
<br><br>
            As social beings one of the many reasons that we seek interactions is the need for a shared experience and to meet likeminded people.
             Spontaneous social interactions can be stimulated by creating an experience or space that triggers people to speak, or ‘sparks them do discus’.  
            <br><br>
            While thinking about what I learned so far, I decided that I wanted to come up with concept focussed on the following elements:  
            <br><br>
          </p>
        <p>
           
            <br> - The need to voice your opinion
            <br> - The feeling of belonging
            <br> - Visualizing the results(of a large group)
        
        
<br>
The survey:<br>
As I have mentioned in , creating a space allows the opportunity for spontaneous interactions and hopefully sparks a conversation, this can be done by asking simple and concise questions. Questions related to the festival or related to the artists. 
I would not advise picking any controversial topics or sensitive subjects. These questions can be selected by the artist and the Effenaar. <br>
<br> Output of the results:<br>
What are we going to do with the results of the survey?<br>
Just like any other voting system with percentages. Bars that represent with two colors and each color represents one of the answers. <br> <br>
            <b>Installation</b>
            It could be projected on a screen or it can be shown in a physical structure or installation. In order for me to visualize the results of survey in a 
            fun and abstract way, I decided to expriment with different animations in Adobe XD.

    <h3>Phase one</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, I want to create a space that allows the opportunity for spontaneous interactions and hopefully spark a conversation. This could be done
         by asking simple and concise questions. For example, questions related to the festival or related to the artists. I would not advise picking any controversial
          topics or sensitive subjects. These questions could be preselected, in collaboration with the artists or there representative and the Effenaar to flavour it to
           their own performance. 
        <br><br>
        In first phase I came up with two types of questioning and developed one of them. The concept I did not initially develop, was to create a quick poll with a 
        few questions, that had two opposing answers. The other concept I did develop was a type of poll that would have a singular question, with a multitude of answers;
         e.g. What’s your favourite album? Who is your favourite band member? Etc. You can see my first iteration in the video down below.  
        </p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>First Version</h3>
    <p>
        First version 
For the first version of the discussion sparkers, I created a visual with the top most listened songs by Drake. An online visitor would be prompted with the question 
“what’s your favourite song’, via a pinned message in the chat of something alike. The result would be visible via an installation on a screen, where QR codes could be 
located to allow the physical visitors to join in on the voting experience. As soon as the visitors entered a poll, they can see a real time physical representation of 
the results, both online and in the physical world. Hopefully this creates an environment that opens up the opportunity for spontaneous interaction.

<div class="col-md-12">
    <h3>Second Version</h3>
    <p>After creating the first version, I wanted to allow myself to come up with some different versions with a more creative style. You can see the versions in the video below.
         These versions are based on the preferred album of the band Muse.  </p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-12">
    <h3>Third Version</h3>
    <p>For the last version I kept the same results and artist, but then visualised in circles. The higher the amount of votes for an album, the bigger the album 
        "circle". </p>

        <h3> <strike>Disccussion</strike> - Conversation Sparkers <b>Physical Structure</b></h3>
    Many big festivals have these giant sculptures or structures that pull the audience and give them an “Otherworldly” experience. 
    A mechanical structure would be fun to create but can be quite a daunting task. A projector would still be too flat. 
    Looking at the time constraint at this point in time [4 weeks] we decided to stick with
    a simple structure that contains LED strips. Each LED would represent the results of the survey. <br> <br>
    First shape:
    <br>
    The structure needs to be quite large in order to draw people in.<br>
    Now, how big and how many frames are we talking about?
    How many LED’s do we need? <br>
   <br>
    Now that we can visualize the idea, how will the survey take place? What kind of questions should the survey have? How should we show the results with LED’s?<br>
    
    <br>
  
</p>
    

</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
    <img src="img/clientproj/visual1.gif">
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
   <h3> How will the LED’s Behave?</h3>
  As soon as a festival visitor fills in the online survey, that is available by scanning a QR code located in front of the structure. 
  The results are shown in small increments and the colors correspond with the questions. This shows the users their answers in relation 
  to the other visitors that are there. 
  How and where will the festival visitors view the results?
