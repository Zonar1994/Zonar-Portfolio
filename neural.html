            <h3>Neural Headset Research</h3>
            <h4>What are we working with here?</h4>
            
  
        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p> 

            People with severe disabilities are very limited when it comes to a simple everyday taa simple everyday tasks.
             Using a pen device to control a mobile phone or a joystick on a wheelchair is one of the many ways people with 
             disabilities can perform these simple everyday tasks. For this project, I am going to focus on Quadriplegia patients. 
             Having only mobility in their neck, head, and in some cases a couple of fingers. 
            These patients have a caretaker to help with most tasks. But giving them more independence will give them more freedom and
             make them feel empowered. One last task that they can do themselves, without a caretaker, will improve their quality of life.
              Independence and freedom for everyone.  
            Neural headsets are nowadays readily available and relatively cheap. These headsets are equipped with EEG and motion sensors. For 
            this project, I will be using the Emotiv Epoc X neural headset. </p>
            <h5>What is a Neural Headset?</h5>
            A Neural Headset can record the electrical activity of the brain. This is done with an EEG headset  s a wearable device for electroencephalography. EEG sensors in headsets place electrodes along the scalp to detect brain activity.  
<h5>Electroencephalography (EEG) </h5>
<p>The billions of cells in your brain produce very small electrical signals that form non-linear patterns called brainwaves. An EEG
     machine measures the electrical activity in the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain, during an EEG test. EEG sensors are 
     placed on a participant’s head, then the electrodes non-invasively detect brainwaves from the subject. 

    EEG sensors can record up to several thousands of snapshots of the electrical activity generated in the brain within a single second.
     The recorded brainwaves are sent to amplifiers, then to a computer or the cloud to process the data. The amplified signals, which resemble
      wavy lines, can be recorded on a computer, mobile device, or on a cloud database. 
    
    Cloud-computing software is considered a critical innovation in EEG data processing, as it allows for real-time analysis of recordings at scale
     — in the early days of EEG measurement, waves were simply recorded on a graph paper. EEG systems, in academic and commercial research, typically
      show the data as a time series, or as a continuous flow of voltages. </p>
      <h5>EmotivBCI (Brain Computer Interface)</h5>
      <p> 

        Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) is a system that allows you to control machines using your brain activity directly, rather than through 
        intermediary interfaces like a mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, or voice. EMOTIV technology converts brain waves to digital signals that can 
        be used to control an endless number of digital outputs such as games, IoT devices, communication devices and audio/visual content. EmotivBCI 
        is a desktop application for Mac and Windows that allows you to view and train the EMOTIV data streams used for BCI. These data streams are the
         following: 
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Mental Commands</strong> allow active control with specific patterns of brain activity that you have trained the system to recognize. You 
            can train up to 4 commands per training profile with an unlimited number of profiles. 
</p>
           <p> <strong>Performance Metrics</strong> allow passive and continuous control based on your real time cognitive state, including measurements of focus, excitement,
                interest, engagement, stress and relaxation. No training is required. </p>
            
     
            </p>
          <p><strong>  ​Facial Expressions</strong> trigger events with movements of your facial and eye muscles. No training is required, but you can train some
             expressions to make them more accurate and personalized. 
            </p>
        <p><strong>​Motion Sensors </strong> your head movements which you can apply to move a mouse or trigger other commands. </p>
        <h5>Training the <strong>Mental Commands</strong></h5>
        <p>For this project we want to allow our users to interact with their IoT devices by using the Neural Headset. The Neural Headset will pick up
             the electrical activity in the brain and translate it into commands. These commands will be sent to our React Application with the Cortex API.
              This React Application will then trigger the predetermined events for the IoT Devices. </p>
              <h5>How will the User interact with the Neural Headset and Iot Devices? </h5>
              <p> 
                The user will need to ask their caretaker to put the Neural Headset on their head. Once the headset is placed on the head.
