        <h3>What is this 'festival feeling' we are trying to recreate at our virtual festival ground regarding interaction and what is the motivation behind it? </h3>
        <p>
            In order for me to understand how I can create an experience for a hybrid festival. I need to understand why people go to festivals 
            in the first place.<br> What is the motivation behind going to a festival? What is that festival feel? <br>
            Is it more than just a reason to get absolutely hammered? 
             I found an article on the festival feeling and a research paper on Social motives for visiting music festivals.

            <h4>Literature Study</h4>
<p>The ambiance of a music festival sparks a light inside anyone attending. The electric energy pulsating through the crowd is an addicting rush that unites 
    every single concertgoer in perfect harmony.<br><br>
    If you've ever been to a festival, you know what I'm talking about (and I don't just sound crazy). It's an adrenaline rush like you've never experienced 
    before, and it's not just the drugs.<br><br>
    A good festival experience will consist of meeting people you never normally would, listening to the sweet melodies of music you've never heard before
     and making golden memories you can keep with you for the rest of your life.<br><br>

        <p>There’s something special that happens when we’re at a festival that is difficult to translate online. In these physical spaces, everything boils down 
            to a bubble and all that matters is what’s happening at that moment. You know the feeling: real life is put on hold, everyone is on the same level and 
            you interact with others in a way that you normally wouldn’t. The girl you just met is an accountant in the real world but in here, she’s wearing sparkly
             leggings and handing out vodka jellies! That random guy over there in a bra and pantyhose is a history teacher in real life. You’d never run up to him 
             and give him a fist-bump during his history class, but in here that’s exactly what you’re doing. What a legend! Everyone’s so nice in here! Why can’t 
             normal life be like this?</p>

    <p>According to S.JT Wetzels from the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Science, the social motivation of these music 
        festival visitors is influenced by all the four motivational forces: the desire to seek personal intrinsic rewards,
         seek interpersonal intrinsic rewards, escape the personal environment, and escape the interpersonal environment.</p>

       <p><b>Seek personal intrinsic rewards</b></p>
         <p>There are many feelings that we should consider here. Humans are curious and motivated to learn new things. Achieving a
             certain status or achievement, can be quite rewarding. But going to a festival does not give us any concrete achievement 
             that raises our status or gives us a medal for participating. Going to festivals is purely to connect with others at a shared experience. </p>
<p><b>Seek interpersonal intrinsic rewards</b></p>
<p>As social beings we always want to share an experience, whether that is with a friend, family member or a random person at the festival. Having a shared 
    experience is crucial to festivals.</p>
    <p><b>Escape personal environment</b></p>
    <p>At times life can be quite heavy and daunting, you got a lot on your plate and you want to just escape all of these responsibilities for a while.. Going 
        to a festival would be perfect to escape reality for a little bit.</p>
        <p><b>Escape interpersonal environment</b></p>
        <p>Seeing a friend struggling through the same thing can also be a motivation to go to a festival. Pulling your friend out of the dumps and get a shared 
            experience at the festival that is not so far away. </p>
     <h3>Conclusion</h3>
     <p>Understanding that people go to festivals for many different reasons, whether it is longing for a mystical feeling or escaping from the tight grip
         of societal pressure to succeed, every one might have a reason to go to a festival. </p>
     <p>
    The festival feeling is different for everyone, but after reading many articles and research papers, it boils down to the following: 
    Freedom, community, escape, shared experience and togetherness.
    <br>
    At first, I thought that the motivation behind going to festivals was grounded in the escape from reality or escaping reality with your friends.
     But this research shows that people go to these festivals for other reasons as well. Understanding all the different motivations behind festivals
      gave me more insights into how to create a festival experience that regards all the motivations behind going to a festival. The insights should also 
      be applied to the “online” version of a festival. Doing this research gave me a more accurate vision on the motivation behind festival visitations, this allows me to 
      create a broader range of user experiences.
