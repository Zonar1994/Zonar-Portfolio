            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>In the Creative Coding workshop, I got inspired to create art with data. Geert-Jan, my teacher, showed us
                this video of an artist that made these interactive square tiles.
                The trigger for this interaction was sound. Whenever anyone would approach these tiles, small little
                stickmen would pop out from the side. It is a quite simple, but fun way of creative coding.
                While watching this video, a freight train passed by on the tracks next to my house and everything
                started shaking. This happens every time a freight train passes by.
                This gave me the idea to generate art with the train vibrations. From that idea, I instantly thought of
                a Bob Sliding video that I watched the week prior.
                According to Vox, Bob Sliders get constant vibrations while sledding. And even small vibrations can
                result in serious brain injuries.
                That brings me back to the train vibrations. How bad are the vibrations caused by freight trains? </p>

                <p>I am currently living next to a railroad, and I can feel apartment swaying from left to right every
                    time a freight train passed by.
                    I want to visualize these vibrations on a monitor using Processing.
                    These can be complex or simple, not sure yet. But these will make me more aware how often and how
                    severe these vibrations really are. </p>

            <ul class="cat-ul">
                <p>According to the RIVM and multiple news articles, 16% of the Dutch population, that live next to rail roads, 
                    get sleep disturbance from passing by freight trains. The findings show that combined vibrations and noise from 
                    railway freight affects the natrual rhythm of sleep, but extrapolation of significance for health outcomes should
                    be approached with caution.  </p>

            <h4>How does it affect the sleep cycle?</h4>
            <ul class="cat-ul">
                <p>An average sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes. Ideally, you need four to six cycles of sleep every 24 hours to feel fresh and rested.
                     Each cycle contains four individual stages: three that form non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and one rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.</p>
                    <p>The graphs shows the frequentie of the vibrations. These trains are passing by every hour. Meaning that the vibrations disturb the sleep cycle of a person
                living next to railroad. </p>

            <h4>How could I visualize the vibration data from freight trains?</h4>
            <ul class="cat-ul">
                <p>In the Creative Coding workshop I created a simple project in Processing. This showed me how I can create visuals with code. 
                    It was simpile and easy to understand. I am already familiar with Processing and I wanted to add what I learned from the previous
                semester. </p>

            <ul class="cat-ul">
                <p> With Pulses you can use drawing instruments that can follow a rhythm or abide by rules independent of drawn gestures. 
                    This is a form of collaborative drawing in which the draftsperson controls some aspects of the image 
                    and the software controls others. </p>

            <h3>Accelerometer Experiment</h3>
            <h4>Let's measure those vibrations!</h4>
            <ul class="cat-ul">
                <p>I hooked up my Raspberry Pi 4 to my monitor and connected the Accelerometer sensor mpu-9250/6500. The vibrations were measured
                    with a Python script that I got from a YouTube tutorial. The video on the right shows the Accelerometer in action!   </p> 
                    <p>The positioning of the accelerometer was important for capturing the vibrations from the train. It had to be elevated in order
                        to be completely still and ready to record the vibrations.

            <ul class="cat-ul">
                <p>After the workshop, I wanted to think of different ways the data from the freight train vibrations could be visualized.
                     Since the vibrations are disturbing sleeping patterns, I wanted to show how frequent and annoying they are. 
                     What if the visual was a flower and the flower represents sleep. As the vibrations pass, the flower slowly deteriorates.  </p>

            <h4>Elevate the Accelerometer</h4>
            <ul class="cat-ul">
                <p>In order to get the most accurate vibrations from the passing by Freight Trains, I will have to elevate the Accelerometer.
                    This can be done by creating a setup with the Raspberry Pi and Accelerometer on a platform and elevating that platform  with strings.
                    The platform will be able to swing around and allowing the Accelerometer to pick up acurate vibrations from the passing by freight trains. </p>

            <ul class="cat-ul">
                <p>Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to convert the data from the accelerometer into visuals with Processing. 
                    Together with the time constraints, I opted for a less digital approach. 
                    I stumbled upon a fun cup experiment video that included a DC Motor and pens. 
                    The vibrations from the DC motor vibrated the cup and then the pens would start drawing on the paper below. 
                    This gave me the idea to send the data from my accelerometer and make the cup move every time a train passed by! 
                    And at the end of the day, I will have a visual representation of the train vibrations
