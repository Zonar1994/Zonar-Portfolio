                    This my reading guide for my final project of Semester 6! With my interest of AI and my new
                    internship as an AI researcher and Prompt engineer, I wanted to create a final project that would
                    mash these two new developments together.

                <h3><b>Scope of the project</b></h3>
                <p>
                    I conducted extensive research on various aspects of AI assistants for email processing. This
                    research involved delving into topics such as computational trust models, user experience
                    factors,
                    societal implications, privacy concerns, and common sense in AI. After exploring these areas, I
                    realized that creating a fully functional AI email assistant would be a challenging task.
                    However, I
                    recognized the potential for a great proof of concept. Therefore, I decided to focus on
                    developing a
                    prototype of an AI email assistant that can perform tasks like composing and sending emails,
                    organizing incoming emails, suggesting replies, and providing reminders.

                <p>
                    User stories, outlining user needs for an AI email assistant, guided my project's direction. These
                    stories targeted actions like composing emails, categorizing messages, suggesting responses, setting
                    reminders, and retrieving information. They shaped the prototype's design by defining its core
                    functionalities and serving as benchmarks for successful implementation. These stories ensured a
                    user-centric focus throughout my research, development, and reflection stages, aligning project
                    outcomes with user needs, thereby improving the assistant's usability and effectiveness. In essence,
                    they provided a structured, iterative approach to the project, maintaining a clear focus on
                    enhancing the user experience.

                <p>


                    To better understand how an AI assistant can be utilized in a business setting, I conducted research
                    by closely observing a consultancy business where I currently work as an AI researcher. This
                    firsthand experience provided valuable insights into the specific needs and challenges faced by the
                    business. Through techniques like discreet observation and actively participating in their tasks, I
                    learned about their requirements for automation, the need for speed and efficiency, complex
                    processes they handle, effective task management, and the importance of data security. These
                    insights guided the development of an AI assistant prototype tailored to meet the consultancy
                    industry's unique needs.

                    To create an AI assistant, it is essential to consider key factors. Yejin Choi's research highlights
                    the challenges of large language models (LLMs) and the importance of common sense. Integrating
                    smaller, safer AI systems imbued with human norms and values can address these concerns. Theory of
                    Mind (ToM) is crucial for developing assistants that understand user queries in a human-like manner.
                    Evaluating ToM abilities through specific benchmarks and considering dataset difficulty levels
                    enhances training. Incorporating common sense, transparency, and democratization creates
                    intelligent, ethical, and reliable AI assistants.

                <p>
                    I developed a Chatbot Email Assistant to streamline email processing in organizations using n8n
                    workflow automation and the CHATGPT API. The system categorizes incoming emails into HR, Marketing,
                    Sales, or Finance departments using nodes I designed for tasks such as email receiving, department
                    selection, and response generation. A unique dataset trained the AI assistant for each department.
                    The prototype utilizes an Email trigger node with IMAP, which listens for incoming emails and
                    enables the assistant to generate structured responses. Rigorous testing assured optimal model
                    parameters, resulting in a reliable and efficient email processing system.

                        Throughout the course of this project, I had the opportunity to explore my interest in AI while
                        incorporating my new job as an AI researcher into a personal project. This combination allowed
                        me to delve deeper into the world of AI and gain valuable insights along the way.
                        led my passion to continue learning and exploring the
                        possibilities of AI in the future.

                    <p>
                        One of the key takeaways from this project was the immense knowledge I acquired about new AI
                        technologies and their practical applications. Through extensive research, I discovered various
                        methodologies and best practices for developing AI assistants, particularly in the context of
                        email processing. Understanding the theoretical foundations and ethical considerations
                        surrounding large language models (LLMs) provided me with a comprehensive understanding of their
                        potential impact and challenges.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, the exploration of hallucinations in AI systems proved to be highly insightful.
                        Investigating how these distortions occur and identifying strategies to address them highlighted
                        the importance of responsible development and incorporating common sense in AI models.
                    </p>
                    <p>In terms of practical skills, I honed my abilities in using the automation tool n8n. This allowed
                        me to streamline email processing by developing a Chatbot Email Assistant prototype. The
                        hands-on experience with n8n's workflow automation and integrating it with the CHATGPT API
                        provided me with a deeper understanding of how AI assistants can be implemented in real-world
                        scenarios.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, experimenting with an email client server further expanded my technical skills and
                        knowledge. This experience enabled me to develop a better understanding of the intricacies
                        involved in email processing and management, and how AI can be leveraged to enhance these
                        processes.</p>
                    <p>Overall, my goal for this project was to explore and experiment with AI, and I am delighted to
                        have achieved that. Not only did I gain valuable insights and knowledge about AI, but I also had
                        the opportunity to apply what I learned in a practical setting. This project has deepened my
                        understanding of AI and has further fueled my passion to continue learning and exploring the

                        And due to time-span of the personal project, I was not able to touch upon every aspect of the
                        DOT Framework.
                        Lab and Showroom are the two that I did not have any time for. But even though I could not get
                        to them, I am still happy with the prorotype
                        that I created. This showed me that AI can be implimented in a small but effective way!
