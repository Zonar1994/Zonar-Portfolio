                <h3><b>AI Assistants for business</b></h3>
                <p>

                    I conducted a research project on AI assistants for businesses, focusing on their role and
                    impact.
                    The study examined motivations behind using AI assistants and explored ethical and effective
                    ways
                    businesses can leverage them. Key research sources included papers by Chen and Reilly, and Babu
                    Kumar et al. Various aspects were investigated, such as user experience, societal impacts,
                    privacy
                    concerns, communication patterns, user trust, and technical capabilities. The study also
                    acknowledged the significance of IoT devices in enhancing user efficiency. The ultimate
                    objective
                    was to develop an ethical and user-centric AI assistant prototype for efficient email
                    processing,
                    showcasing AI's transformative potential in daily life and business operations.

                <p>
                    I conducted extensive research on various aspects of AI assistants for email processing. This
                    research involved delving into topics such as computational trust models, user experience
                    factors,
                    societal implications, privacy concerns, and common sense in AI. After exploring these areas, I
                    realized that creating a fully functional AI email assistant would be a challenging task.
                    However, I
                    recognized the potential for a great proof of concept. Therefore, I decided to focus on
                    developing a
                    prototype of an AI email assistant that can perform tasks like composing and sending emails,
                    organizing incoming emails, suggesting replies, and providing reminders.

                <p>
                    In order for me to understand a LLM could possibly behave autonomously, in a way that it could solve
                    problems and remove any<a

                    I set out to find out the Best, good & bad practices.
                    in LLM's, espescially those with large training data.

                    I explore the "Chain Of thought" and "Tree of Thought" reseach papers and try to gather insights on
                    how I could create this AI assistant.
                <ul>
                    <li>Chain-of-Thoughts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enhances reasoning capabilities of AI models.</li>
                            <li>Improves understanding of context in business scenarios.</li>
                            <li>Enhances advanced skills like arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning.</li>
                            <li>Achieves high accuracy, crucial for effective decision-making.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Tree of Thoughts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improves decision-making by considering multiple reasoning paths.</li>
                            <li>Enhances problem-solving abilities, useful for troubleshooting and complex business
                                problems.</li>
                            <li>Enables planning and search tasks, beneficial for project management and data analysis.
                            </li>
                            <li>Facilitates adaptive learning and improvement of AI assistant's responses over time.
                            </li>
                            <li>Enhances natural language processing for better understanding and response to user
                                queries.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                </ul>
                Overall, integrating these methodologies, such as Auto-GPT, can create more autonomous and capable
                problem-solving agents in various domains, benefiting businesses and improving AI assistant
                interactions. Responsible and ethical development is crucial for their successful implementation.

                <p>

                    To create an AI assistant, it is essential to consider key factors. Yejin Choi's research highlights
                    the challenges of large language models (LLMs) and the importance of common sense. Integrating
                    smaller, safer AI systems imbued with human norms and values can address these concerns. Theory of
                    Mind (ToM) is crucial for developing assistants that understand user queries in a human-like manner.
                    Evaluating ToM abilities through specific benchmarks and considering dataset difficulty levels
                    enhances training. Incorporating common sense, transparency, and democratization creates
                    intelligent, ethical, and reliable AI assistants.

                <p>
                    I developed a Chatbot Email Assistant to streamline email processing in organizations using n8n
                    workflow automation and the CHATGPT API. The system categorizes incoming emails into HR, Marketing,
                    Sales, or Finance departments using nodes I designed for tasks such as email receiving, department
                    selection, and response generation. A unique dataset trained the AI assistant for each department.
                    The prototype utilizes an Email trigger node with IMAP, which listens for incoming emails and
                    enables the assistant to generate structured responses. Rigorous testing assured optimal model
                    parameters, resulting in a reliable and efficient email processing system.
