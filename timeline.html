                <p>
                    Welcome to my reading guide for semester six! I'm excited to work on a range of creative projects
                    that will challenge my skills and creativity. This reading guide covers the approach and results of
                    projects that
                    I will be working on this semester.
                    <br>
                    The semester is divided into three main projects: <b>start-up project</b>, <b>client project</b>,
                    and <b>individual project</b>. During the
                    first six weeks, I'll work on a start-up project to come up with innovative ideas. Next, I'll spend
                    seven weeks working
                    on a client project, gaining experience working with external clients. Finally, I'll have the
                    opportunity to explore a
                    topic that interests me during the last five weeks.
                    <br>
                    I'll document my approach and results for each project to reflect on my progress, identify areas for
                    improvement, and
                    track my learning outcomes.

                <h3><b>"It's a Match" AI tools for Investigative Journalism</b></h3>
                <h5>week 1/2</h5>
                The project started off with a briefing with Marius Brugman and Berry Sanders, a Journalist and overseer
                of the “It’s A
                Match project. The overall objective was to make AI tools user-friendly for investigative journalists.
                Marius Brugman
                and Berry Sanders, our clients, wanted us to create an interface that incorporates AI capabilities. We
                collaborated with
                software and journalism students to achieve this. We had the option to either build a new tool or
                improve an existing
                one to meet the journalists' needs.
                <br>
                During the
                introductionwe were given the option to choose the direction we wanted to go as a group with a concept,
                several tools were presented as options for us to work on if we were interested. One
                of the ideas being considered is to develop an <b>easy-to-use timeline</b>. Our group found this idea
                fascinating and decided to focus on it for the project. We collaborated to brainstorm and explore
                the possibilities for creating a timeline.

                <h3><b>Project Plan and picking a Data-set</b></h3>
                <p>
                    As a group we created a project plan in order to scope out the entire project. This included our
                    objectives, scope, deliverables and the a rough timeline of the project. With this complex project,
                    I decided to formulate sub-questions within the project plan and added main questions as well.
                    Triangulating the suq-questions seemed to be the most effective way on figuring out how to tackle
                    this project.
                    <br>
                    At this point we also decided which data-set to pick for the timeline project. The <l>corona curfew
                        protest</l> has been documented by many civilians through social media and investigative journalist have been trying to 
                        log each and every social media post/article. This dataset would then be used to find out how the protests spread that day. Therefore arranging this dataset in a chronological order would be one way of 
                        tackling this investigation.

                    The "timeline" project is a concept that can put large sums of data into a time line. This allows an
                    investigative journalist to arrange and view a large data set in a chronological order. In order to
                    analyze these large sets of data and the put them in a chronological order, each data item should be
                    analyzed by AI tools. These AI tools can range from object detection to complete 3D scan
                    analyzations.

                    <br>
                    Overall, both Lerf and video-based crime prediction(deep learning) technologies have potential
                    applications in investigative journalism. Leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence,
                    will allow the timeline tool to arrange the data-sets in a chronological order.

                    After gaining insights on developing a tool to enhance the workflow of investigative journalists, we
                    moved on to the design phase. Using Figma, we created the initial design with a focus on data

                    verifying and organizing data items chronologically. The goal is to utilize AI to analyze the
