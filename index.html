       <h3>Introduction </h3>
       <br>
       <div id="text">
       <p> 
        Welcome to my reading guide for semester six! I'm excited to work on a range of creative projects
        that will challenge my skills and creativity. This reading guide covers the approach and results of projects that
        I will be working on this semester.
        <br>
        The semester is divided into three main projects: <b>start-up project</b>, <b>client project</b>, and <b>individual project</b>. During the
        first six weeks, I'll work on a start-up project to come up with innovative ideas. Next, I'll spend seven weeks working
        on a client project, gaining experience working with external clients. Finally, I'll have the opportunity to explore a
        topic that interests me during the last five weeks.
        <br>
        I'll document my approach and results for each project to reflect on my progress, identify areas for improvement, and
        track my learning outcomes.

       <h2>Start-up Project</h2>
           <h5>week 1/2</h5>
      For my first project in semester 6 of Media Design, I get to create a startup company with my group! I'm thrilled to
      start this exciting challenge that demands creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking. We will also
       receive feedback from <a href=https://hike.one/">Hike One</a>, a UX Design company, through weekly meetings. With
      Hike-One's critical feedback and feedforward, we can refine our ideas and make progress towards creating a successful
      startup. <br>
      As a group we decided to use the Double Diamond for the design process, all of my group members are familiar with this design process
      and therefore it was an easy decision to go for that design process.
           <br>
           <br>
           <h3>Brainstorming new ideas</h3>
     
           
          
      </div> 
      <div class="col-md-12">
  <p>
    Our journey to create a start-up began with the generation of ideas and concepts. To facilitate this process, we
  experimented with various brainstorming techniques, including Flower Association. This approach led us to come up with
  several innovative and creative ideas, many of which were focused on sustainability.
  After receiving feedback from our teachers, we narrowed down our list of ideas to two distinct and exciting concept:

<br>
<br>
<p>
  Fontys Community: <br>
  An online community platform for students that allow them to communicate, host events, do user testing, and much more. 
</p>
<p>
  Ai Recipe Generator: <br>
  An application that can generate personalized recipes based of off user input. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  At one point the majority of the group, including myself was really excited about the AI Recipe Generator, partialy due to
  the fact that the idea was generated by an AI, chatGPT and I have been really inspired by all of these new advancements
  in artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  During this time we also generated different names for the application as well with the help of chatGPT. We did this until we landed on: <i>Recipeazy</i>
