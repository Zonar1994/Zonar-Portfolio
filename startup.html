                <p>
                    Welcome to my reading guide for semester six! I'm excited to work on a range of creative projects
                    that will challenge my skills and creativity. This reading guide covers the approach and results of
                    projects that
                    I will be working on this semester.
                    <br>
                    The semester is divided into three main projects: <b>start-up project</b>, <b>client project</b>,
                    and <b>individual project</b>. During the
                    first six weeks, I'll work on a start-up project to come up with innovative ideas. Next, I'll spend
                    seven weeks working
                    on a client project, gaining experience working with external clients. Finally, I'll have the
                    opportunity to explore a
                    topic that interests me during the last five weeks.
                    <br>
                    I'll document my approach and results for each project to reflect on my progress, identify areas for
                    improvement, and
                    track my learning outcomes.

                <h5>week 1/2</h5>
                For my first project in semester 6 of Media Design, I get to create a startup company with my group!
                I'm thrilled to
                start this exciting challenge that demands creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking. We will
                also
                receive feedback from <a href=https://hike.one/">Hike One</a>, a UX Design company, through weekly
                meetings. With
                Hike-One's critical feedback and feedforward, we can refine our ideas and make progress towards
                creating a successful
                startup. <br>
                As a group we decided to use the Double Diamond for the design process, all of my group members are
                familiar with this design process
                and therefore it was an easy decision to go for that design process.

                <p>
                    Our journey to create a start-up began with the generation of ideas and concepts. To
                    facilitate this process, we
                    experimented with various <b>brainstorming</b> techniques.

                <p>
                    At one point the majority of the group, including myself was really excited about the AI
                    Recipe Generator, partialy due to
                    the fact that the idea was generated by an AI, chatGPT and I have been really inspired by
                    all of these new advancements
                    in artificial intelligence.

                    <b>Defining the target group audience</b>
                </h3>

                <p>
                    To get a multiple
                    target audience research (<b>library research, surveys, and in-depth interviews</b>). These studies
                    revealed the following: <li>Millennials (aged 25 to 45) are the primary target audience for our
                        platform.</li>
                    <li>This group often
                        experiences difficulties in finding suitable recipes and may have little time or inclination to
                        put in a lot of effort themselves.</li>
                    <br>
                    Since the age range of
                    Millennials is quite broad, we have used <b>behavioral archetypes</b> to better understand the needs
                    and preferences of our
                    target audience and tailor the platform accordingly. I focused on the <b>Cook Enthousiast</b> and
                    the application will need the following:  <br>
                  
                    <li>ustomized recipe recommendations for dietary preferences and cooking style.</li>
                    <li> Reliable nutritional information and clear instructions. </li>
                    <li>Time-saving features for meal planning and grocery shopping.</li>
                    During this time we also generated different names for the application as well with the help of
                    chatGPT. We did this until we landed on: <i>Recipeazy</i>.

                <p>
                    We made sure everyone was on the same page by creating mood boards that were linked to the
                    behavioral
                    archetypes. To
                    further refine the archetypes and focus on behavior, we then made adjustments. Additionally, we
                    developed concept
                    boards, storyboards, and a customer journey to analyze the product's flow and features. To
                    prioritize
                    the features, we
                    also utilized a Moscow approach. Once we reached a consensus, we created the logo and based the
                    stylescape on it.

                    To design Recipeazy, an app for health-conscious cooks, I created a moodboard with images that
                    reflect the needs and preferences of target group audience. I also made a fresh and fun logo with a
                    green leaf
                    and playful font.
                    Then, I used the Moscow method to prioritize the app's features into four categories: must have,
                    should
                    have, could
                    have, and won't have. This helped me focus on developing essential features first to deliver value
                    to the target users. I focused on creating the system that uses artificial intelligence to generate recipes.

                    Based on my research, I have concluded that ChatGPT is the ideal AI technology to generate
                    personalized
                    recipes. To complement this, I used Dall-e to generate images of these personalized recipes. Both of
                    these services are provided by OpenAI through their respective APIs. By leveraging these APIs, I was
                    able to create an application that performs the required tasks of generating personalized recipes
                    and
                    images. The OpenAI offers a range of generation models that are capable of various tasks.<br>

                    <b>Developing application</b>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I utilized React and Next.js to create the recipe generator website, as these technologies allow for
                    seamless page updates and easy conversion to a Progressive Web App. To kickstart the development
                    process, I followed an openai tutorial on creating a superhero name generator for pets. That
                    tutorial
                    was then put into the public ChatGPT as a prompt and at first it generated irrelevant code, but
                    after
                    trail and error with a lot of
                    back and forth, I was able to create the first version of the Recipeazy prototype. By conversing and
                    itterating, I automatically started to understand
                    how the API endpoint worked. Despite undergoing continuous development, the
                    current version still experiences some bugs, primarily due to high traffic on the chatgpt website.
                    These
                    errors will be addressed in the next iteration of the application.
                    Finally, I created a Discord bot in Python that allows users to communicate with a virtual chef.
                    This
                    bot leverages the capabilities of Chat GPT and offers a unique user experience.

                start-up. Most of the ideas we generated were focused on
                creating something innovative or solving ambitious problems. Finally, an idea generated by an AI,

                of the application. Immediately, we divided the task
                into designing and developing. Although I wanted to do both, I had an affinity for artificial
                intelligence,
                so I gradually started doing more development than usual. I created a concept board and logo, worked on
                the
                style scapes, and helped a lot with the entire wireframe. Even though I added many things to the
                wireframe,
                I don't want to say that I contributed much, so I didn't mention it in my portfolio. I will tackle that
                in
                the next project. As I was using ChatGPT, I saw how easy it was to develop new programs. Of course, you
                need
                some knowledge of programming, but generating new components or fixing syntax errors gets pretty easy.
                During this project, I also gave a workshop about ChatGPT and how to use it effectively. Over time, I
                learned a lot of tidbits about working with ChatGPT.

                Overall, I learned a great deal about working together in a group. It was very fun to plan everything
                ahead
                and create something that could exist in the world. We tackled it professionally, and my teammates were
                also
                professional at their work. I think this was a very smooth project process overall, and I of course I
                learned a
                great deal about working with artificial intelligence, which is going to pave the way for the future.
