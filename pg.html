        <h3>Personal Growth</h3>
        <p> Since 2020, I have been struggling with my schoolwork. This was rooted in a lot of personal issues, 
            and the global ones. Now that a lot of time has passed, things have changed for me. Not only did my need to pass this semester 
            successfully, but so did my drive to do it. <br>

            In order to guarantee my own success I looked back on the feedback I have received, advice from people around me and my own person 
            thoughts on my progress. I quickly realized that the main skills I lacked, or at least slacked on in the last for years were:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Showing initiative; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Being proactive; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Communicating with my coaches. 
                </li>
            </ul>
             
            <h3>Exploring different and new things</h3>
            Of course there where plenty of other things I could work on, like having a more creative outlook, communicating 
            with my group mates and more. However I thought that by working on the points listed above, I would naturally allow 
            and push myself to work on these other skills.  <br><br>
            Before I worked on these points, I first wanted to work on my motivation and getting back into the (live) school system in general. 
            My personal- and my duo project allowed me the opportunity to get started on this. Being creative, and exploring different things is 
            something that excites and inspires me.<br> <br>

This is why I choose to make my personal project about something uniquely different than I have at previous personal project. I generally formed those 
around my hobbies, but this semester I decided to form it around my homelife, specifically the effect of trains passing by. By choosing a project I wasn’t 
as comfortable with, I needed to come up with and try different solutions in order to get to a conclusion.   <br><br>

After my personal project, I worked on my duo project. Here I didn’t focus as much on different approaches, but settled on one 
aproach that was new to me, neuro-homes. The target audience we were creating a product for, quadriplegics, was new to me as well. 
Working for people who use tech to bring their life up to a comfort level that I personally perceive as ‘standard’ or ‘normal’ inspired
 me to think more about such approaches. It felt uniquely different than working on project that improve a ‘normal’ level of life comfort.
  It also showed me how many things I use in life, would need to be adjusted for people with a disability. There is many different things and 
  ways you can think about making an app or other project more accessible to everyone.  <br><br>
 <h3>Working on my goals</h3> <br>
 Together these two project allowed me to get back into the rhythm of school, start working on my communication and 
 it inspired and motivated me. After this it was time to fully focus on the skills I choice to improve upon this semester. 
 I started out by being more proactive and showing initiative withing my group for the Effenaar. This naturally progressed into
  me taking a leadership role, which I soon realized was a great role to practice my skills with.  
  <br><br>
 When I asked my group how they experienced me being a leader, they were all very positive. They told me I made sure everyone voiced 
 their opinion and that the workload was shared evenly. I also made sure we did I proper start up and stand down on daily basis. Lastly 
 they mentioned I communicated our progress in a timely manner to our teachers and called in for help when needed. This last point was one 
 of my goals as well, so this something I purposefully initiated.  
 <br><br>
 When I look back on my own progress I agree with al their points. However I also personally perceived some things I could tackle in a
  different way. While I split the workload evenly for my groupmates, I failed to properly put boundaries on the amount of work I did myself.
   This combined with being the leader and offering help to everyone whenever needed, caused me to have some issues with my own workload. I 
   could also do a better job at delegating in general. Even though it was great for my own learning goals, being the group leader and communication
    person is a bit much for a group of 7. These task logistically could have been split. I also thought about the fact, that just because I have this
     role and generally lead the conversation in meetings, this doesn’t always have to be the case. Other people who want to work on their own goals
      would benefit from leading a conversation once in a while and I would benefit from making a more conscious choice on my work load.  
      <br><br>
 As I mentioned above, being a leader helped me work on my communication skills. Not only with the coaches, but also with my own group. 
 The main lesson I take from that is to let go sometimes. In the end of my project I realized that some things just aren’t my responsibility.
  All I can really do as a group leaders is try to track their intended progress versus their outcome, and adjust the plan of the group accordingly.  
  <br><br>
 When it comes to communicating with my coaches, I would say I made a lot of progress as well. I proactively asked for help and made appointments 
 with them. In the past I would typically wait till I had no other choice, or the teachers would aproach me. I think something that really helped 
 here is that I had the same semester coach as last time. Because I had a pretty rough time, I benefited from someone that understood where I came 
 from and what my personal struggles were, even now that things are easier. My current semester coach, Eva, understands my growth curve and has given 
 me usefull advice on how to make progress in school.  <br>
 I also realized that motivation was still sometimes an issue for me. Not so much motivation in general, but mostly motivation while working under pressure
  of deadlines. This is something I am looking into solutions for, but haven’t quite figured out yet. Once I realized this became a problem for certain deadlines,
   I decided to talk to Geert and Eva about this. Together we came to a solution that would work for that time.  
   <br><br>
   <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
   Looking back on my entire progress I can see I have grown a lot in learning about what motivates me and what doesnt,
    and how to be proactive and take initiative. Properly communicating, naturally happened by mostly focusing on these two skills. 
    These are skills that I hope to continue working on throughout school, but especially during my internship. I believe they will make
     me a better worker and will naturally allow me to work on a lot of other skills, just like it did with communication.
