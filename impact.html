            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <h4>What is the impact of this new technology?</h4>
            <p> The clear impact of this project is giving more freedom and independence to 
                people that are bound by wheelchair. But what does it mean to have freedom and
                 independence? Feeling free is different for every single person. It is not an 
                 achievement you unlock that you don't have to worry about after receiving it. 
                 Freedom is rather a state of mind, a state that you need to nurture and truly believe.</p> 
                 <h3>Freedom and independence</h3>
                 <p>At a young age, we are taught to be independent of our parents. Learning how to dress ourselves every
                      day and taking steps to become an independent adult. In those early years, you learn to create building
                       blocks for a self-sufficient working adult, an adult that does not need any help to get through life.</p>
                       <p>Independence is easily defined with clear lines, but following these clear lines is not always that easy. 
                           People that are unfortunate enough to be bound by a wheelchair are not able to go through the day-to-day life 
                           without any intervention from their friends/family/caretakers. </p>
                           <p>Being independent will empower the individuals that are bound by wheelchairs, taking control of their lives and 
                               being part of society. Inclusivity does not stop at race, sex, or religion, but it should also include people in 
                               less fortunate positions. </p>
                               <div>
                                   <p>Freedom is something entirely different. As freedom is a state of mind, one can attain freedom by merely 
                                       believing that one is free to do whatever they wanted. Needs and desires differ from one another. </p>

                               <div>
                                   <p>After reading <a href="https://studentsforliberty.org/north-america/pillars/peace-love-liberty/human-rights/"> “What does it mean to be free?”</a> by Students For Liberty organization I found a perfect description 
                                       of freedom: </p>
                               </div>
                               <p>“To be FREE is to be cared for, humanized, trusted, guided, driven by the good, named, self-regulated, charitable, 
                                   enlightened, reasonable, self-directed, believed, incalculable, indispensable, open, advised, by equals who have neither
                                    the right nor wisdom nor virtue to command and control the course of our lives. To be FREE is to be at every moment, in 
                                    every human exchange, given the opportunity to choose, to be counted on, requested, de-objectified, self-evaluated,
                                     individualized, appreciated, considered competent, self-authorized, respected, unencumbered, whole, informed, rewarded.
                                      It is, without pretense, and as a matter of fact, to be an essential contributor to our collective well-being, 
                                      self-disciplined, secure, ennobled, collaborated with and enriched by the experience; then, just as it seems it could 
                                      not get any better, ever grateful to be alive, to be uplifted, gifted, praised, supported, protected, cherished, defended, 
                                      empowered, unconstrained, relieved, liberated, helped, accepted, strengthened, accommodated, exalted, dignified, committed
                                       to; like nothing else, to be built up, commended, distinguished, blessed, honored. That is freedom; that is justice; that
                                        is morality.”</p>
