                Group Project: Enhancing the LAIO system | Journalism
            </h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Our project, a collaboration with Innovative Origins, embarked on enhancing the existing AI system
                responsible for generating news articles. Our diverse team, comprising talents from software
                development, AI, cybersecurity, media design, and business economics, was asked to enhance the system's
                fact-checking capabilities, thereby elevating the reliability of content produced.
            </p>
            <div class="project-planning-phases">
                <h3>Project Planning Phases</h3>
                <p>We began by establishing a clear proposal that defined our objectives. The main goal was to build an
                    AI component that could analyze text and distinguish facts from opinions, aiding journalists in
                    producing articles more efficiently.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Discover Phase:</strong>
                        Worked together with Journalist to generate news articles with AI tools and created a
                        demonstration video for that. Initial research involved studying LLMs for fact-opinion
                        differentiation and investigating
                        various AI agents and methodologies like Langchain and LAIO.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Define Phase:</strong>
                        We assessed the societal impact using a TICT scan and defined the technological needs to ensure
                        ethical considerations were woven into our development process. We also worked on instructions
                        for
                        langchain agent, defining the flow of a journalist.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Develop Phase:</strong>
                        The development phase was initiated with a prototype demonstration, with a set deadline for a
                        working model by late November.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Deliver Phase:</strong>
                        The concluding phase was dedicated to finalizing the prototype, documenting our findings, and
                        outlining recommendations for the systemâ€™s future improvements.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Discover Phase: The world of Journalism</h3>
            <p>In a week-long session with journalists, we, a group of IT students, partnered with them to produce
                articles quickly. We used AI tools like ElevenLabs for voiceovers, ChatGPT for article writing, and
                AgentGPT for extra information. The journalists showed us how they work daily, giving us useful tips on
                using AI in their field. Together, we made a demo video about a made-up bombing in the Netherlands,
                demonstrating how AI can help in making news stories by turning the latest info into a narrated report.
                This showed us that journalists could use better tools for quick research, and it guided us in making AI
                tools to help them gather the latest news faster.</p>

                    Brabant Video</a></li>
            <p>
                In the Discover phase of our project, I focused on researching how AI can tell facts from opinions in
                news writing. Using tools like ChatGPT and other LLMs, I worked on defining clear criteria to separate
                factual statements from opinions. My approach involved collecting news articles and analyzing their
                content to see how facts and opinions are presented differently. This task was challenging, as it
                required fine-tuning the AI to accurately identify these differences. The results of this research
                helped us understand better how AI can be used to improve the reliability of automated journalism.

            <h3>Define Phase: What is the impact of these systems?</h3>

            <p>In the Define phase of our project, we collectively developed a TICT scan to evaluate the societal and
                ethical implications of our AI-driven journalism tool. This scan was crucial for identifying potential
                risks and ensuring our approach aligned with responsible AI practices. Through this process, we gained
                insights into the broader impact of our work on society and journalism, guiding us to develop our AI
                solution in an ethically conscious and socially responsible manner.</p>

            <h3>Develop Phase: Langchain Agents</h3>
            <p>In the Development phase of our project, my key contribution was creating the n8n Langchain agent, an AI
                tool designed to streamline journalistic tasks. This development involved integrating various AI
                components to automate processes like information gathering and article summarization. Alongside
                building the agent, I also compiled comprehensive documentation. This documentation detailed the
                functionalities, capabilities, and potential applications of the n8n Langchain agent, serving as a
                valuable guide for users and team members. The creation of this agent and its accompanying documentation
                marked a significant step in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of AI in journalism.</p>

                    Documentation</a></li>

            <h3>Deliver Phase: Presenting LAIO+</h3>
            <p>In the Deliver phase of our project, I presented our developed n8n Langchain agent and its capabilities
                to both our clients and teachers. The presentation was well-received, highlighting the practical
                application and effectiveness of our AI tool in the context of journalism. This positive response
                validated our efforts and the potential of AI in enhancing journalistic practices.

                Additionally, I had the opportunity to showcase our work at the Innovative Insights event. This
                presentation was also met with enthusiasm, further affirming the relevance and impact of our project.
                The positive feedback from diverse audiences at both events underscored the successful integration of AI
                in journalism, as demonstrated by our n8n Langchain agent, and marked a significant achievement in our

                of adhering to a research methodology and establishing a clear plan early on. The experience with
                Langchain agents was invaluable, and I plan to integrate these tools into future projects wherever
                possible.<br>
                <b>Project Challenges and Areas for Improvement:</b><br>
                While I am pleased with the overall outcome, the project did face its share of challenges. The
                development phase, in particular, was more time-consuming than anticipated. Establishing an effective
                project plan took longer than expected, which initially slowed our momentum. In retrospect, a more
                streamlined planning process and quicker decision-making could have accelerated our progress.
<br>
                <b>Team Dynamics and Overcoming Obstacles:</b><br>
                Our team dynamics were generally positive, but managing task durations and coordinating efforts
                effectively was an area of struggle. As an informal leader, guiding the team through these delays and
                ensuring we stayed on track was a learning experience. Balancing leadership with collaboration,
                especially when tasks took longer than planned, was a significant aspect of my role.F
