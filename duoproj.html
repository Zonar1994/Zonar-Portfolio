            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>After the fun and explorative train vibrations project, I moved on to the DUO Project. In this project,
                 I partnered up with Maarten, a software student that I connected with on the first day of this specialization.
                  We decided early that we wanted to continue Maarten’s project. He developed an application that utilized Eye Tracking
                   software to control smart devices. Maarten was developing this for a friend of his that is Quadriplegic and therefore 
                   is bound to a wheelchair. With this unfortunate situation, Maarten was able to effectively give his friend more freedom
                    and independence. This blew me away at the expo for the personal projects. Together with my love for home automation and 
                    helping people, I offered to continue the development of Maarten’s project.  </p>

                    This semester we used the Creative Technology Design Process tool to combine the engineering design process
                     and the design thinking process. The CTDP tool consists of five phases, Trigger, Ideation, Specification & Design,
                      Realization, and Evaluation.

                     technologies used to excite me. The biggest investments are put into digitizing human interaction in the last couple of years.
                      That is the exact opposite of my vision. Technology should not replace our most basic social interaction. Touch, presence, and energy. 
                 Next to that, I want to create a world that develops technology in an ethical and impactful way and ensures that everyone can benefit from that new technology.
                That is where the creativity comes in, not only focusing on making something fun and useful but also making sure that anyone can use it!

                    In order to get better insisghts on how Quadriplegic users interact with technology in their day to day lives, Maarten and I set up an Interview
                    with someone with that condition. This was a friend of Maarten and he was more than welcome to answer all of our questions.

                   The interview gave us insights on how a quadriplegic user interacts with technology in their daily lives. 
                   In some cases quadriplegic patients can experience speech impediment due to the paralyzation. Therefore being unable to 
                   use speech recognition software to control their devices.

                <p>
                    The clear impact of this project is giving more freedom and independence to people that are bound by wheelchair. But what does it mean to have 
                    freedom and independence? Feeling free is different for every single person. It is not an achievement you unlock that you don't have to worry about
                    after receiving it. Freedom is rather a state of mind, a state that you need to nurture and truly believe.
