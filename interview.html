            <h3>Interview</h3>
            <h4>Target group audience</h4>
           <p>This interview was conducted with quadriplegic user by Maarten. It is important to know what the pains and gains are from our users.
            Knowing what their day to day life will be crucial to finding out what their pains and gains are. Understanding the limitations that they are  
            faced with in their condition. This interview proved to be quite fruitfull.

           <h5>What are technological issues and irritations that you often run into? </h5>
           <p>I got a robot arm, which can hold a joint. It’s a 3rd word problem, but I cannot light it myself. 
               I always need someone to do it for me. Since I smoke for my physical pain, it would be nice to be able to do this myself.  
           A bigger issue is that whenever I try to use my pc, my hands need to be in a very specific position. This position is different
            from where my hands are whenever I’m driving my wheelchair. This means that every time I switch between working on my pc and doing 
            something else, I need someone to help me.   </p>
            <h5>How do you control your pc at this moment? </h5>
            <p>I got a wireless mouse, which we flipped over. This means that the buttons are on the bottom. I can click these by putting pressure
                 on the mouse. Next to that, I’ve got a keyboard which has 8 buttons. These are used to use shortcuts, either in Ableton, word or another 
                 program. I also have Tobii eye tracking glasses, but don’t really use them, since it is way slower than using my mouse and keyboard. I do
                  use them to login to my pc, since that has facial recognition. I can also control my Pc with my wheelchair. Unfortunately my pc cannot handle 
                  this at this moment.  </p>
                  <h5>How is controlling your phone for you? </h5>
       <p>Currently I use a pen, that is mounted next to my phone. Whenever I want use my phone, I can grab this pen with my mouth. I can then use this pen to control my 
           phone.  </p>
           <h5>Have you ever looked into controlling your phone via eye tracking?</h5>
           <p>No I have never checked this before. If it is just software and I do not use hardware it would be nice to use this. Especially when I’m in bed, or another situation where I’m not in my wheelchair. At that point I am not in the right position to use the pen and control my phone. I do have to say that replacing the pen will probably not be the best option, since the pen is quite fast to use.  

            I can mount the phone holder that’s on my wheelchair to my bed, so I can see it. Controlling it is no longer possible then. Something that allows 
            me to use it would be great.  </p>
            <h5>Are face gestures easy accessible?</h5>
            <p>I do have to movement in my head. But using eye tracking would be way more convenient.  </p>
            <h5>Do you have anything else to mention to use, that we should keep in mind during our brainstorm and design process</h5>
            <p>A lot of “replacement” hard- and software is there to completely replace whatever you are using. This means that I lose the possibility to use my keyboard with shortcuts as soon as I start using the eye tracking to control my pc. This makes it so inconvenient that working with just the keyboard and mouse is preferred. 

                My blinds are another issue. They are totally manual at this moment. I cannot close or open these myself now. So controlling this would be a great bonus -> smart blinds? </p>
