            <h3>Semester Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                Over the course of the sixth semester, my educational and personal growth have been immense. The
                combination of theoretical learning, practical application, and hands-on project work allowed me to
                delve deeper into the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and understand its wide-ranging
                implications and potential.

                One of the major highlights of this semester was the development of my professional skills. The projects
                not only taught me to work collaboratively but also enabled me to become more assertive, allowing me to
                take on challenges with confidence and positivity. This assertiveness was particularly crucial during
                the start-up project, where we designed and developed an AI Recipe Generator application. The process of
                creating the app required a keen understanding of the Double Diamond design process and the use of
                advanced technologies like ChatGPT and Dall-e from OpenAI.

                The experience of giving a workshop on ChatGPT was incredibly rewarding. This opportunity allowed me to
                delve into the depths of this AI technology, researching its capabilities, exploring its application,
                and sharing the knowledge with my group mates. The presentation I gave to Interpolis further reinforced
                my understanding of AI and its contemporary developments.

                My increasing interest in AI and new technologies led me to work on an innovative project that aimed to
                make AI tools user-friendly for investigative journalists. In this project, I realized the
                transformative potential of AI in journalism and the ethical considerations it brings along. This
                hands-on experience was instrumental in understanding how AI can be incorporated into different fields
                in a responsible, functional, and effective way.

                The final project of the semester allowed me to blend my newfound interest in AI with my new internship
                as an AI researcher and Prompt engineer. Creating a prototype of an AI email assistant was a challenging
                yet fulfilling task that provided valuable insights into automation, speed, efficiency, and complex
                processes. It also shed light on the importance of integrating human norms and values into AI models.

            <h3>Startup Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                At the beginning of the project it took us a while to figure out what we were going to create for out
                start-up. Most of the ideas we generated were focused on creating something innovative or solving
                ambitious problems. Finally, an idea generated by an AI, specifically ChatGPT, came up: an AI recipe
                generator. We also used ChatGPT to for inspiration for the name of the application. Immediately, we
                divided the task into designing and developing. Although I wanted to do both, I had an affinity for
                artificial intelligence, so I gradually started doing more development than usual. 
                <br><br>
                I created a concept
                board and logo, worked on the style scapes, and helped a lot with the entire wireframe. Even though I
                added many things to the wireframe, I don't want to say that I contributed much, so I didn't mention it
                in my portfolio. I will tackle that in the next project. As I was using ChatGPT, I saw how easy it was
                to develop new programs. Of course, you need some knowledge of programming, but generating new
                components or fixing syntax errors gets pretty easy. During this project, I also gave a workshop about
                ChatGPT and how to use it effectively. Over time, I learned a lot of tidbits about working with ChatGPT.
                <br><br>

                Overall, I learned a great deal about working together in a group. It was very fun to plan everything
                ahead and create something that could exist in the world. We tackled it professionally, and my teammates
                were also professional at their work. I think this was a very smooth project process overall, and I of
                course I learned a great deal about working with artificial intelligence, which is going to pave the way
                for the future.

            <h3>It's a Match</h3>
            <p>
                The "It's a Match" project marked a significant departure from my previous development-centric
                engagements, presenting an exciting exploration into the integration of AI within journalism. The
                project, though comprehensive and complex, unfolded as an intellectually stimulating journey,
                particularly given the freedom to delve into my areas of interest, most notably artificial
                intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                My fascination with AI quickly snowballed throughout the project's progression, eventually leading
                to a workshop I conducted on Chatgpt. I found this endeavor particularly gratifying, as it allowed
                me to impart AI knowledge to my groupmates, while also fostering a broader understanding and
                appreciation for the technology's potential within myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                A defining aspect of the project was the development of a timeline tool. This offered the unique
                challenge of applying AI to process and chronologically present vast amounts of data - a process
                that seamlessly married logic and design. The complexity of the task, coupled with the tangible
                utility it offered to investigative journalism, was invigorating and rewarded us with a rich sense
                of accomplishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, striking the balance between research and design was a challenge in itself. Despite my
                inclination towards design, the allure of research was irresistibly captivating. The thrill of
                unearthing new AI potential was exhilarating, so much so that I found myself desiring more time
                dedicated to this aspect of the project. In retrospect, this underscores the evolving direction of
                my interest and passion.
            </p>
            <p>
                An integral part of the project's success was the collaborative dynamics of my team. Our shared
                dedication and collective motivation fostered a supportive environment, allowing each of us to bring
                our unique skills and perspectives to the project.

                Reflecting on the project, it emerges as an enlightening journey into AI's transformative potential
                within journalism. It provided me with a platform to enhance my research skills, deepen my
                understanding of AI, and appreciate the essence of effective teamwork. More than just a project, it
                was an enriching learning experience that has expanded my intellectual horizons and prepared me to
                face future challenges and opportunities with a sharpened set of skills and renewed confidence.

            <h3>AI Assistant</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout the course of this project, I had the opportunity to explore my interest in AI while
                incorporating my new job as an AI researcher into a personal project. This combination allowed
                me to delve deeper into the world of AI and gain valuable insights along the way.
                led my passion to continue learning and exploring the
                possibilities of AI in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the key takeaways from this project was the immense knowledge I acquired about new AI
                technologies and their practical applications. Through extensive research, I discovered various
                methodologies and best practices for developing AI assistants, particularly in the context of
                email processing. Understanding the theoretical foundations and ethical considerations
                surrounding large language models (LLMs) provided me with a comprehensive understanding of their
                potential impact and challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the exploration of hallucinations in AI systems proved to be highly insightful.
                Investigating how these distortions occur and identifying strategies to address them highlighted
                the importance of responsible development and incorporating common sense in AI models.
            </p>
            <p>In terms of practical skills, I honed my abilities in using the automation tool n8n. This allowed
                me to streamline email processing by developing a Chatbot Email Assistant prototype. The
                hands-on experience with n8n's workflow automation and integrating it with the CHATGPT API
                provided me with a deeper understanding of how AI assistants can be implemented in real-world
                scenarios.</p>
            <p>Moreover, experimenting with an email client server further expanded my technical skills and
                knowledge. This experience enabled me to develop a better understanding of the intricacies
                involved in email processing and management, and how AI can be leveraged to enhance these
                processes.</p>
            <p>Overall, my goal for this project was to explore and experiment with AI, and I am delighted to
                have achieved that. Not only did I gain valuable insights and knowledge about AI, but I also had
                the opportunity to apply what I learned in a practical setting. This project has deepened my
                understanding of AI and has further fueled my passion to continue learning and exploring the
                possibilities of AI in the future.
            <br>
            And due to time-span of the personal project, I was not able to touch upon every aspect of the DOT Framework. 
            Lab and Showroom are the two that I did not have any time for. But even though I could not get to them, I am still happy with the prorotype
            that I created. This showed me that AI can be implimented in a small but effective way!
