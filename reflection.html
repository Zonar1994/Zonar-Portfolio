            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <h4>Let's reflect on the semester</h4>
            <h5>Personal Project</h5>
            <p>This semester I dove deep into train vibrations and learned a lot more about accelerometers.
                 My persona project was very insightful and made me a lot more aware of the train vibrations.
                  My vision for this semester was to create smart home automation applications and solutions that
                   work alongside humans instead of being in the way. On the day of the Launch week, I got inspired to
                    create a “vibration measuring cup” started kit for other people that live next to railroads. This will 
                    bring more awareness to the train vibrations problem. Hopefully, the Dutch government will change the regulations 
                    on living next to railroads.   </p>
        
        <h5>Duo Project</h5>
        <p>In the beginning of this semester I wanted to create technology that will help us in our day-to-day lives. Refraining from 
            the technology that renders us lazy for the rest of eternity, but by applying ethical strategies and critical thinking to the
             design process of every project. </p>
             <p>Technological advancements have been pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human. Agriculture and sewage systems are 
                 technologies that are fully integrated into our day-to-day lives. These technologies have transformed society as we know it. 
                 Harvesting to our hearths content and flushing away it never to be seen again. You can argue the fact that the world as we know
                  it, cannot live without these two technologies. But then when you look at the extent that we are currently harvesting in the 
                  Netherlands and other countries, you can see that we have gotten lazy from this luxury. Yes, everyone deserves food and a place 
                  to live. But is this not too excessive? </p>
                  <p>We have developed a world that allows us to get whatever we wanted by just lifting our fingers. 
                    This project gave me a different perspective on what technology is and how I can use it to improve my own life and the others around me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>After being inspired by Maarten’s personal project, I quickly decided to continue with his project and help him improve it. 
                        At first, I wanted to see if I could improve the user interface and user interaction. But before I even started looking into that,
                         I got suggested to try to work with the neural headset. This sparked the curiosity of Maarten and I, and we quickly made our way to
                          the ISSD to experiment with a neural headset.</p>
                          <p>Whenever something piques my interest, I tend to research everything about it. I’ve read an extensive amount
                               of research on neurology and neural headsets. Since we wanted the neural headset as a remote and your electrical brain 
                               activity as fingers that press on this remote, I had to understand how these fingers work!</p>
                               <p>Learning about that noggin of ours, gave me a lot of insight on how the user interface should be developed.
                                    The progress bar was one of the ideas that came up quite early during the development of the Neural Home application. </p>
                                    <p>Next to all of that, it was an absolute joy to work on this project and to work towards a future that includes everyone!
                                         Of course, the prototype that we created was just the first step. But if I had more time, I would have finished the entire
                                          User Interface with React. Together with more user testing and feedback. Apart from those things, I would have also liked 
                                          to explore different kinds of input devices. For example, instead of a dedicated for the Neural Home, I could use a smart
                                           watch as a means for input feedback. </p>
