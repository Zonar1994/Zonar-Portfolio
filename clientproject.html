                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In the last eight weeks of Creative Technology, I formed a group with Negin, Eugene, Yue, Maarten and
                    Anouk.
                    The six of us worked on the Client Project together. The design process will be the same as the
                    previous project, with the CTDP Tool.
                    <br>
               The <b>Effenaar</b> gave us the design challenge that resonated with us: Music Festivals.
                    A creative director from the Effenaar presented a rather interesting design challenge to us that
                    resonated with us.
                    <br>
                    The Corona pandemic catapulted the growing demand of live streams and put a lot of venues at risk.
                    Luckily the Effenaar already had live
                    streaming capabilities on their own hosting service, sessions. The Smart Venue, one of the
                    experimental departments from the Effenaar, experiments
                    with new and emerging technologies. The session streaming platform showcases these experiments
                    whenever they come out. This is accompanied by live
                    performances and an interview with the creators.

                <h4>Effenaar</h4>
                <p>
                 
                    
                    De Effenaar is a multifunctional pop stage with two halls, a restaurant-café and its own backyard. However, we also program in places 
                    in Eindhoven that enhance the atmosphere of a concert; a skate park, a church, the Klokgebouw or a green part of the city such as Groendomein 
                    het Wasven. Besides the concert and dance programming, we organize festivals with international allure such as Eindhoven Metal Meeting, Come As You Are,
                     DDW Music and Fuzz Club.

                <p>
                A venue that allows upcoming new artist to preform in the city of Eindhoven. Preforming at the Effenaar
                and various cafe's throughout Eindhoven. The genre's range form
                Indie, hip-hop, garage and singer-songwriters. <br> The main purpose for venues are to promote new artists
                and engage converstations about sensitive, controversial and political
                subject. From gender neutrality to economical crisis, all of these subjects are brought up at these
                venues. The following video shows the vibe of the Hit the City festivals/venues.

                <h4>Sessions</h4>
                 <p>The Sessions is a live-platform created to showcase and support bands and musicians online. It started as The Isolation Sessions in march 2020 at the beginning of 
                     the corona-lockdown.

                    The sessions are intended to allow musicians and audiences to enjoy live music in this worldwide crisis on a daily basis. Effenaar promoter Robert Schaeffer: 
                    "The Effenaar is the amplifier of the pop culture of Eindhoven and this collaboration fits in perfectly. We strive to bring the passion of the musicians to the
                     audience homes. During the sessions the guidelines of the RIVM are of course meticulously observed.”
                    
                    The Sessions is a collaboration between Dynamo, Effenaar, Copyright Delta and of course: all the amazing musicians.</p>

               <h5>Design Challenge</h5>
                <p>The concept for a <b>virtual festival</b> site containing <b>different
                        functionalities/experiences</b> for visitors visiting <b>Hit the City</b></p>
                        <p>These functionalities should be applicable to other festivals and venues that Effenaar supports.</p>

                <h4>Flower Brainstorm</h4>
                <p>The Session platform already has a live streaming function and they are experimenting with virtual rooms in a 3D environment. This gives us a lot of room for creativity and is 
                    why I decided to brainstorm new ideas for this project. This was done by using the Flower Brainstorm method.

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h4>Physical festival vs Online Festival</h4>
                <p>There are still many aspects that are connected to this hybrid festival. Is it important that the festival visitors, whether online or physical, should have the same
                     experience? 
                    It should share the same core values, but not be the exact same thing. In order for us to create an exact replica of a physical festival experience, we would have to
                     use Virtual Reality. And that is simply not feasible, not only do we not have the skill and expertise, virtual reality headsets are currently not readily available or
                      affordable for the average person. 
                    Understand the current boundaries, we <b>must</b> make a distinction between these two worlds. This increases the feasibility and gives us room to experiment with different 
                    technologies.</p>
                    <p>Now that we have established the following ground rules:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Physical and online should be different</li>
                        <li>Virtual Reality is not an option </li>
                        <li>Interaction is key</li>
                        <li>Festival feeling is necessary</li>
                      </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Moodboards</h4>
                <p>I decided to create moodboards that captured the festival feeling and new/emerging technologies.</p>
                <p>Stage diving, crowd interaction and mosh pitting is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about festivals. When the audience is connected to the 
                    artist, their intrinsic rewards get fulfilled to an extent with a large group of people. Feeling not only connected to the artist but also the people around them. 
                    Feeling euphoric and energetic with like minded people. </p>
