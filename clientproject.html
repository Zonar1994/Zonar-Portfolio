                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In the last eight weeks of Creative Technology, I formed a group with Negin, Eugene, Yue, Maarten and Anouk. The six of us worked on 
                    the Client Project together. The design process will be the same as the previous project, with the CTDP Tool. <br>

                    The Effenaar gave us the design challenge that resonated with us: Music Festivals. The Effenaar wants us to merge the gap between 
                    an online and live festival. And they wanted us to start experimenting with the Hit The City festival. <br>
                    
                    Luckily the Effenaar already had live streaming capabilities on their own hosting service, sessions. The Smart Venue, 
                    one of the experimental departments from the Effenaar, experiments with new and emerging technologies. The session streaming 
                    platform showcases these experiments whenever they come out. This is accompanied by live performances and an interview with the creators.<br>

                <p>
                    The Effenaar is a multifunctional pop stage with two halls, a restaurant-cafe and its own backyard.
                    However, they also have programs throughout Eindhoven
                    that enhance the atmosphere of a concert, a skate park or the "Klokgebouw". The Effenaar also
                    orginaizes
                    festivals with international allure such as Eindhoven Metal Meeting, Come As You Are, DDW Music Fuzz
                    Club and <b>Hit The City</b>. he festival that we need to start with, but the solution should be 
                    applicable to a wider range of festivals, not just Hit The City
                </p>

                <p>
                    A venue that allows upcoming new artist to preform in the city of Eindhoven. Preforming at the
                    Effenaar
                    and various cafe's throughout Eindhoven. The genre's range form
                    Indie, hip-hop, garage and singer-songwriters. <br> The main purpose for venues are to promote new
                    artists
                    and engage converstations about sensitive, controversial and political
                    subject. From gender neutrality to economical crisis, all of these subjects are brought up at these
                    venues. The following video shows the vibe of the Hit the City festivals/venues.

                <h3>Sessions</h3>
                <p>The Sessions is a live-platform created to showcase and support bands and musicians online. It
                    started as The Isolation Sessions in march 2020 at the beginning of
                    the corona-lockdown.

                    The sessions are intended to allow musicians and audiences to enjoy live music in this worldwide
                    crisis on a daily basis. Effenaar promoter Robert Schaeffer:
                    "The Effenaar is the amplifier of the pop culture of Eindhoven and this collaboration fits in
                    perfectly. We strive to bring the passion of the musicians to the
                    audience homes. During the sessions the guidelines of the RIVM are of course meticulously observed.”

                    The Sessions is a collaboration between Dynamo, Effenaar, Copyright Delta and of course: all the
                    amazing musicians.</p>

    <h3>Interview with Jos (Effenaar)</h3> </a>
    At this point in time we had many questions about these hybrid festivals and what Effenaar expects us to create. What are the 
                requirements? In order for us to get answers on these critical questions, we conducted an interview with Jos from the Effenaar. A creative 
                director at the Effenaar that is in touch with all of the venues, including the Smart Venue and Hit The City.
                <br>

                        functionalities/experiences</b> for visitors visiting <b>Hit the City</b></h2>
                <p>These functionalities should be applicable to other festivals and venues that Effenaar supports.</p>

                <h3>Flower Brainstorm</h3>
                <p>The Session platform already has a live streaming function and they are experimenting with virtual
                    rooms in a 3D environment. A hybrid festival, what is that really?
                    Does this have to be virtual reality? Augmented Reality? What type of interactions would there be?
                    How would we merge the online world with the physical world?
                    <br>
                    Looking at the flower brainstorm on the right, it was clear to use that a hybrid festival can be
                    done in many different ways. There are already Virtual Festivals happening
                    all over the world. One of these "Hybrid" festivals is called <b>Splendour</b>, a festival with an
                    physical festival and a virtual counterpart. People can navigate with their
                    own personalized avatar and enjoy the festivals virtually and physical, while having the same
                    experience. The online counterpart can be exprienced with a Virtual Reality headset
                    and for the ones without these headsets, there is still a live stream of the festival on their
                    website.
                    <br>
                    Knowing that Virtual Headseets is still not being used enough and you need a capable pc to have a
                    decent experience, it was best not the go for a method that uses these
                    headsets.

                <h3>Physical festival vs Online Festival</h3>
                <p>There are still many aspects that are connected to this hybrid festival. Is it important that the
                    festival visitors, whether online or physical, should have the same
                    experience?
                    It should share the same core values, but not be the exact same thing. In order for us to create an
                    exact replica of a physical festival experience, we would have to
                    use Virtual Reality. And that is simply not feasible, not only do we not have the skill and
                    expertise, virtual reality headsets are currently not readily available or
                    affordable for the average person.
                
            
                <p>These limtations change the vision and opens doors for new possibilities. Creating a world in VR would be ideal,
                    but a flat screen is a difficult challenge. Understand the current boundaries, we <b>must</b> make a distinction between these two worlds. This
                    will narrow down our scope and gives us room to experiment with different technologies.
                   In my previous projects I added new insights to my vision, but I never subtracted them. I know now when developing a vision, one must add new insights, but also 
                   know when to let go of previously gathered insights. 
                </p>
                </p>
                <p>These are the keypoints I concluded should be added to the vision:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Physical and online should be different</li>
                    <li>Virtual Reality is not an option </li>
                    <li>Interaction is key</li>
                    <li>Festival feeling is necessary</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Moodboards</h3>
                <p>I decided to create moodboards that captured the festival feeling and new/emerging technologies.</p>
                <p>Stage diving, crowd interaction and mosh pitting is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking
                    about festivals. When the audience is connected to the
                    artist, their intrinsic rewards get fulfilled to an extent with a large group of people. Feeling not
                    only connected to the artist but also the people around them.
                    Feeling euphoric and energetic with like minded people. </p>

                <h3>First Pitch</h3>
                <p>Due to the amount of freedom and time we had for the first pitch, I decided
                    to come up with three quick idea for our first pitch to the rest of the class. These first ideas are very simple
                    and are already being used by many different live streaming platforms or live concerts. At thispoint we could not phantom any other idea for this vastly broad topic.</p>
                <p><b>Problem definition:</b>
                    How might we make an online festival as interactive and attractive as its physical counterpart.</p>
                <p><b>Tagline:</b>
                    The future is Hybrid</p>
                <p><b>Chat booth / Meet & Greet box:</b></p>
                <p>A physical booth that the artist can use to interact with their online fans. By using timeslots the
                    artist can video call with their
                    online fans. Multiple fans can join the call at the same time. There is a moderator that
                    mutes/unmutes people to guide the conversation.</p>

                <p>This semester there were two other groups that worked on the same Effenaar project. After the second
                    interview with the Effenaar,
                    which was also done together with the other two groups, we decided unanimously that we should split
                    the workload between the three
                    Effenaar groups. Interaction, Navigation and Personalization were the three aspects that were
                    divided between the groups.
                    Our group decided to work on the <b>interaction</b> for a hybrid music festival. </p>

                <h3>Online-online - Online-Physical - Online-Artist</h3>
                <p>There are three types of interactions when it comes to festivals. There are the interactions between
                    the online visitors,
                    the visitors that are the actual festival site and the interactions between the <b>artist and the
                        online/physically present festival visitors</b>.
                    <br><br> I decided to work on the interaction between the artist and the festival visitors(online
                    and physically present). Creating an experience that allows visitors
                    to interact with the artist can be one of the <b>intrinsic rewards</b> to have a shared experience

                    <h3>Disccussion sparkers</h3>
                </a>
                <p> Understading the motivations behind going to a festival that I learned from the <a href="http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=135757">"Gezellig"> research.></a> I created an interactive experience
                    that will fullfill the <b>intrinsic rewards</b> and or <b>interpersonal
                        rewards</b>. Next to that I kept in mind that the experience can not be Virtual Reality and should rather be on a screen. <br>
                         As social beings one of the many reasons can be that we want to seek for a
                    shared experience and meet like minded people. Spontaneous social interations can be stimulated by
                    creating an experience that allows for this to happen.

                <p>
                    That moment when you and your friends appear on the big screens at the festival, this can be a way
                    to create an opportunity to allow interaction to happen
                    between the visitors and the interaction between the visitors and preformers. This is done
                    spontaneously and people have no idea of knowing when they would
                    appear on those screens. What if a festival or concert allowed the audience to project their face on
                    the big screen by using their phone camera.
                    <br> Of course that would be a terrible idea, people would misuse and therefore would not be ideal.
                    But what if you could allow the audience to project stickers or animations on the preformers?

                    <h3>Second pitch for the Effenaar</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Effenaar loved the idea of the Disccussion Sparkers and the Body Projection Mapping. When
                        done right, creating interaction between the
                        visitors and artists can fullfill the <b>intrinsic</b> and <b>personal</b> rewards that festival
                        visitors are looking for. We decided to continue
                        with the two ideas. We had many ideas for Effenaar design challenge, but we were glad that we
                        prioritized our time to just two ideas.

                    <p>
                        Sparking a converstaion sounds friendlier and less confrontational. The idea is to create a
                        space to allow the opportunity for interaction between the festival
                        visitors. <br>
                        Many big festivals have these giant sculptures or structures that pull the audience and give them an “Otherworldly” experience
