                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In the last eight weeks of Creative Technology, I formed a group with Negin, Eugene, Yue, Maarten and Anouk. The six of us worked on 
                    the Client Project together. The design process will be the same as the previous project, with the CTDP Tool. <br>

                    The Effenaar gave us the design challenge that resonated with us: Music Festivals. The Effenaar wants us to merge the gap between 
                    an online and live festival. And they wanted us to start experimenting with the Hit The City festival. <br>
                    
                    Luckily the Effenaar already had live streaming capabilities on their own hosting service, sessions. The Smart Venue, 
                    one of the experimental departments from the Effenaar, experiments with new and emerging technologies. The session streaming 
                    platform showcases these experiments whenever they come out. This is accompanied by live performances and an interview with the creators.<br>

                <h3>The Effenaar</h3>
                <p>
                    The Effenaar is a multifunctional pop stage with two halls, a restaurant-cafe and its own backyard.
                    However, they also have programs throughout Eindhoven
                    that enhance the atmosphere of a concert, a skate park or the "Klokgebouw". The Effenaar also
                    orginaizes
                    festivals with international allure such as Eindhoven Metal Meeting, Come As You Are, DDW Music Fuzz
                    Club and <b>Hit The City</b>. The festival that we need to start with, but the solution should be 
                    applicable to a wider range of festivals, not just Hit The City
                </p>

                <h3>What is Hit the City</h3>
                <p>
                    Hit the city is a venue that allows upcoming artist to perform in the city of Eindhoven, at the Effenaar and various cafe's throughout 
                    the city. The  genre's range from Indie to hip-hop to garage and singer-songwriters. 
<br><br>
                    The main purpose for venues are to promote new artists and engage conversations about sensitive, controversial 
                    and political subject. Because they are open to- and promote a safe environment for these conversations, the topics 
                    at hand have a wide range. Some examples of this would be gender diversity or something like an economic crisis. The 
                    Effenaar shared to  following video with us, to shows us the vibe of the Hit the City festivals/venues.

                <h3>What is the Session Platform?</h3>
                <p>The Sessions is a live-platform created to showcase and support bands and musicians online. It started as The Isolation 
                    Sessions in march 2020 at the beginning of the lockdown. The Sessions are intended to allow musicians and audiences to enjoy
                     live music in this worldwide crisis on a daily basis. The Sessions is a collaboration between Dynamo, Effenaar, Copyright Delta
                      and of course, all the amazing musicians. 
<br><br>
                    Effenaar promoter Robert Schaeffer said the following about Sessions: "The Effenaar is the amplifier of the pop culture of Eindhoven
                     and this collaboration fits in perfectly. We strive to bring the passion of the musicians to the audience homes. During the sessions 
                     the guidelines of the RIVM are of course meticulously observed”.  </p>

    <h3>Interview with Jos (Effenaar)</h3> </a>
    <p>
    At the beginning of the project, after we looked into the information we had about the challenge and the Effenaar itself, we had many 
    questions about these hybrid festivals and what Effenaar expects us to create.
                <br>
                - What are the requirements?  <br>
                - Did they want us to use specific tools?<br>  
                In order for us to get answers on our questions, we conducted an interview with Jos from the Effenaar. He is a  
                creative director at the Effenaar that is in touch with all of the venues, including the Smart Venue and Hit The City. 
<br><br>
Based on the interview, we concluded that it was best to create building blocks, that can be combined and used in different ways so that 
they are applicable for all types of festivals. You can read about the rest of the interview via the link in the title.

                <h3>Flower Brainstorm</h3>
                <p>Our group decided to do a flower brainstorm to get started on the project. Something we kept in mind douring this was 
                    that The Session platform already has a live streaming function and they are experimenting with virtual rooms in a 3D environment.
                     There are a few elements about this brainstorming-session I’d like to highlight because its shows how we originally started forming 
                     our vision.  
                    <br><br>
                    When thinking about a hybrid festival we started by thinking about what this meant to ourselves. Douring our 
                    brainstorming, we found ourselves asking the following questions:    
                    <br><br>
                    - Does this have to be virtual reality? <br>
                    - Does this have to be Augmented Reality?  <br>
                    - What type of interactions would there be?  <br>
                    - How would we merge the online world with the physical world? <br>
                    <br>
                    Looking at the flower brainstorm, it was clear to us that a hybrid festival can be done in many different ways. 
                    There are already Virtual Festivals happening all over the world. One of these "Hybrid" festivals is called Splendour,
                     a festival with an physical festival and a virtual counterpart. People can navigate with their own personalized avatar
                      and enjoy the festivals virtually and physical, while having the same experience. The online counterpart can be experienced 
                      with a Virtual Reality headset and for the ones without these headsets, there is still a live stream of the festival on their website. 
We also realized that Virtual Headsets are still not being widely used and you need a capable pc to have a decent experience. That combined with the 
fact this is something that other venues are doing with a greater level of expertise than we have, we decided it was best not the go for a method that uses 
Virtual headsets.  
<br><br>
The following words were the ones that stood out the most from this Flower Brainstorm: Festival, Entertaining and interactive.

                <h3>Physical festival vs Online Festival</h3>
                <p>
                    There are still many aspects that are connected to this hybrid festival. At first we asked ourselves:
                     ‘Is it important that the festival visitors, whether online or physical, should have the same experience?’. 
                     We concluded that though it should share the same core values, it does not have to be the exact same thing.
                      In order for us to create an exact replica of a physical festival experience, we would likely have to use Virtual
                       Reality, which we previously ruled out for various reasons.  
                
            
                <p>By limiting ourselves, we change the vision and opened doors to new possibilities. To work within our current boundaries, we must make
                     a distinction between the online and physical experience and the tools we can use to enhance and merge them separately. This will narrow
                      down our scope and gives us room to experiment with different technologies. In my previous projects I added new insights to my vision, but
                       I never subtracted them. I know now when developing a vision, one must add new insights, but also know when to let go of ideas to set yourself
                        on a more accurate course towards developing a project.

            <h3>
                Shaping my vision
            </h3>
<p>
    As we were progressing, I decided it was time to compare what I learned so far in the previous steps: 
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>looking into everything we knew about Effenaar, Hit the City and The Session</li>
        <li>the interview with the Effenaar</li>
        <li>the brainstorming session</li>
        <li>the distinction between the physical and online world</li>
    </ul>
<br><br>
Based on everything we learned I wrote down a couple key points about hour vision to keep in mind while shaping our project:  
<br>
<ul>
    <li>physical and online should be tackled differently</li>
    <li>virtual Reality is not an option</li>
    <li>interaction is key</li>
    <li>a festival feeling is necessary, within both worlds</li>
    <li>it needs to be applicable for a wide range of festivals </li>
</ul>

                <h3>Moodboards</h3>
                <p>After narrowing down our vision in general, I decided create mood boards that captured the festival feeling and new/emerging technologies. 
                    This allowed me delve deeper into the feeling we were trying to recreate, online and physically, and it allowed me to start exploring which
                     new emergency technologies, would be worth looking into to (re)create this experience.  
<br> <br>
                    Stage diving, crowd interaction and mosh pitting is the first thing that comes to my mind when thinking about festivals. When the audience 
                    is connected to the artist, their intrinsic rewards get fulfilled to an extent with a large group of people. People are not only feeling connected 
                    to the artist but also the people around them. A shared feeling of euphoria or energy also comes to my mind. . </p>

                <h3>First Pitch</h3>
                <p>Due to the amount of freedom and the short amount of time we had for the first pitch, we decided to come up with three quick ideas 
                    for our first pitch to the rest of the class. These first ideas, are very simple and are already being used by many different live 
                    streaming platforms and/or live concerts. At this point we had not settled on a particular idea, and were still exploring what was out
                     there. What we did know is that we should focus on a specific problem to  tackle:  </p>
                <p><b>Problem definition:</b>
                    How might we make an online festival as interactive and attractive as its physical counterpart.</p>
                <p><b>Tagline:</b>
                    The future is Hybrid</p>
                <p><b>Chat booth / Meet & Greet box:</b></p>
                <p>A physical booth that the artist can use to interact with their online fans. By using timeslots the
                    artist can video call with their
                    online fans. Multiple fans can join the call at the same time. There is a moderator that
                    mutes/unmutes people to guide the conversation.</p>

                <h3>Dividing the tasks</h3>
                <p>This semester there were two other groups that worked on the same Effenaar project. All of our presentations and 
                    interviews were done collaboratively with these three groups. Douring the second interview with the Effenaar, which you can
                     listen to in full over here, we decided unanimously that we should split the workload between the three Effenaar groups. We 
                     divided the design challenge into three different aspects: 
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>interaction</li>
                        <li>navigation</li>
                        <li>personalization</li>

                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even though we collaboratively worked on the challenge, each group worked on one of these aspects individually.
                     We decided that our group would work on the aspect interaction.

                </a>

                <p>Before I dove into the interactions that happen at the festival, whether that is at an online- or a physical festival, 
                     I wanted to understand what that feeling of festival brings you. What is that festival feeling? You can read all about my 
                     research and conclusions via the link in the title.</p>

                <h3>Online-online - Online-Physical - Online-Artist</h3>
                <p>There are three types of interactions when it comes to festivals. There are the interactions between
                    the online visitors,
                    the visitors that are the actual festival site and the interactions between the <b>artist and the
                        online/physically present festival visitors</b>.
                    <br><br> I decided to work on the interaction between the artist and the festival visitors(online
                    and physically present). Creating an experience that allows visitors
                    to interact with the artist can be one of the <b>intrinsic rewards</b> to have a shared experience
                    with their favorite artist.

                </a>
                <p> Understading the motivations behind going to a festival that I learned from the <a href="http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=135757">"Gezellig"> research.></a> I created an interactive experience
                    that will fullfill the <b>intrinsic rewards</b> and or <b>interpersonal
                        rewards</b>. Next to that I kept in mind that the experience can not be Virtual Reality and should rather be on a screen. <br>
                         As social beings one of the many reasons can be that we want to seek for a
                    shared experience and meet like minded people. Spontaneous social interations can be stimulated by
                    creating an experience that allows for this to happen.

                <p>
                    That moment when you and your friends appear on the big screens at the festival, this can be a way
                    to create an opportunity to allow interaction to happen
                    between the visitors and the interaction between the visitors and preformers. This is done
                    spontaneously and people have no idea of knowing when they would
                    appear on those screens. What if a festival or concert allowed the audience to project their face on
                    the big screen by using their phone camera.
                    <br> Of course that would be a terrible idea, people would misuse and therefore would not be ideal.
                    But what if you could allow the audience to project stickers or animations on the preformers?

                    <p>
                        When I look back on my experience I realize I learned a lot with this project. I took a 
                        leadership role in my group, which allowed me to work on my personal goals and growth as you can read here.
                         I also made worked on my learning outcome ‘presenting’, which you can read about over here. Besides that, I feel 
                         like my progress here shows how I progressed in the following learning goals and or outcomes:  
<br><br>
                        <b>Vision</b><br>
                        I started out by doing research on the Effenaar and their own projects to get a view on the potential outcomes. 
                        After I did this I compared what we knew and were capable of and what was already being done relating to hybrid festivals.
                         Based on this I established virtual reality headsets, though they were great for the far future, they were not necessarily
                          or realistically applicable for our group project.
