                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In the last eight weeks of Creative Technology, I formed a group with Negin, Eugene, Yue, Maarten and
                    Anouk.
                    The six of us worked on the Client Project together. The design process will be the same as the
                    previous project, with the CTDP Tool.
                    <br>
               The <b>Effenaar</b> gave us the design challenge that resonated with us: Music Festivals.
                    A creative director from the Effenaar presented a rather interesting design challenge to us that
                    resonated with us.
                    <br>
                    The Corona pandemic catapulted the growing demand of live streams and put a lot of venues at risk.
                    Luckily the Effenaar already had live
                    streaming capabilities on their own hosting service, sessions. The Smart Venue, one of the
                    experimental departments from the Effenaar, experiments
                    with new and emerging technologies. The session streaming platform showcases these experiments
                    whenever they come out. This is accompanied by live
                    performances and an interview with the creators.

                <h3>Effenaar</h3>
                <p>
                 
                    
                    De Effenaar is a multifunctional pop stage with two halls, a restaurant-café and its own backyard. However, we also program in places 
                    in Eindhoven that enhance the atmosphere of a concert; a skate park, a church, the Klokgebouw or a green part of the city such as Groendomein 
                    het Wasven. Besides the concert and dance programming, we organize festivals with international allure such as Eindhoven Metal Meeting, Come As You Are,
                     DDW Music and Fuzz Club.

                <p>
                A venue that allows upcoming new artist to preform in the city of Eindhoven. Preforming at the Effenaar
                and various cafe's throughout Eindhoven. The genre's range form
                Indie, hip-hop, garage and singer-songwriters. <br> The main purpose for venues are to promote new artists
                and engage converstations about sensitive, controversial and political
                subject. From gender neutrality to economical crisis, all of these subjects are brought up at these
                venues. The following video shows the vibe of the Hit the City festivals/venues.

                <h3>Sessions</h3>
                 <p>The Sessions is a live-platform created to showcase and support bands and musicians online. It started as The Isolation Sessions in march 2020 at the beginning of 
                     the corona-lockdown.

                    The sessions are intended to allow musicians and audiences to enjoy live music in this worldwide crisis on a daily basis. Effenaar promoter Robert Schaeffer: 
                    "The Effenaar is the amplifier of the pop culture of Eindhoven and this collaboration fits in perfectly. We strive to bring the passion of the musicians to the
                     audience homes. During the sessions the guidelines of the RIVM are of course meticulously observed.”
                    
                    The Sessions is a collaboration between Dynamo, Effenaar, Copyright Delta and of course: all the amazing musicians.</p>

               <h5>Design Challenge</h5>
                <p>The concept for a <b>virtual festival</b> site containing <b>different
                        functionalities/experiences</b> for visitors visiting <b>Hit the City</b></p>
                        <p>These functionalities should be applicable to other festivals and venues that Effenaar supports.</p>

                <h3>Flower Brainstorm</h3>
                <p>The Session platform already has a live streaming function and they are experimenting with virtual rooms in a 3D environment. This gives us a lot of room for creativity and is 
                    why I decided to brainstorm new ideas for this project. This was done by using the Flower Brainstorm method.

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h3>Physical festival vs Online Festival</h3>
                <p>There are still many aspects that are connected to this hybrid festival. Is it important that the festival visitors, whether online or physical, should have the same
                     experience? 
                    It should share the same core values, but not be the exact same thing. In order for us to create an exact replica of a physical festival experience, we would have to
                     use Virtual Reality. And that is simply not feasible, not only do we not have the skill and expertise, virtual reality headsets are currently not readily available or
                      affordable for the average person. 
                    Understand the current boundaries, we <b>must</b> make a distinction between these two worlds. This increases the feasibility and gives us room to experiment with different 
                    technologies.</p>
                    <p>Now that we have established the following ground rules:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Physical and online should be different</li>
                        <li>Virtual Reality is not an option </li>
                        <li>Interaction is key</li>
                        <li>Festival feeling is necessary</li>
                      </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>Moodboards</h3>
                <p>I decided to create moodboards that captured the festival feeling and new/emerging technologies.</p>
                <p>Stage diving, crowd interaction and mosh pitting is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about festivals. When the audience is connected to the 
                    artist, their intrinsic rewards get fulfilled to an extent with a large group of people. Feeling not only connected to the artist but also the people around them. 
                    Feeling euphoric and energetic with like minded people. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8"> 
                <h3>First Pitch</h3>
                <p>Due to the amount of freedom that we had to create new experiences for hybrid festivals, we decided to come
                     up with three quick ideas for our first pitch to the rest of the class. These first ideas are very simple 
                     and are already being used by many different live streaming platforms or live concerts. At this point we could 
                     not phantom any other idea for this vastly broad topic.</p>
                <p><b>Problem definition:</b>
                    How might we make an online festival as interactive and attractive as its physical counterpart.</p>
                    <p><b>Tagline:</b>
                        The future is Hybrid</p>
                        <p>
                           <p><b> Festival map:</b></p>
<p>This map allows the audience at home to get an overview of the live performances that are at a festival. The user is 
    able to select the desired performance and experience it at home. This map can be exchanged for any map. All stages/booths 
    can be assigned on this map. This map contains a chat where people can converse with each other. An avatar will be displayed 
    on the map based on where you are virtually visiting the festival. Physical visitors can sign into the app and use their GPS 
    to show their avatar on the map.</p>

<p><b>Live festival with chat function:</b></p>
<p>An online platform that hosts the live performances of the festival. This platform contains a chat box that allows the audience at
    home to interact with each other. Each stage can have one of these chat boxes. Every artist can customize their chat (emoji only, customize emojis, etc.)</p>

<p><b>Chat booth / Meet & Greet box:</b></p>
<p>A physical booth that the artist can use to interact with their online fans. By using timeslots the artist can video call with their 
    online fans. Multiple fans can join the call at the same time. There is a moderator that mutes/unmutes people to guide the conversation.</p>

    <h3>Splitting up the tasks</h3>
    <p>This semester there were two other groups that worked on the same Effenaar project. After the second interview with the Effenaar, 
        which was also done together with the other two groups, we decided unanimously that we should split the workload between the three 
        Effenaar groups. Interaction, Navigation and Personalization were the three aspects that were divided between the groups. 
        Our group decided to work on the <b>interaction</b> for a hybrid music festival. </p>

    to understand what that feeling of festival brings you. What is that festival feeling? </p>
